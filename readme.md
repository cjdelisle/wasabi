# WasmABI

Run C code, compiled to WebAssembly, as if it were native code.
This is really experimental but is able to make a hello world run on amd64/linux.

To reproduce:

```bash
node ./syscall_tbl/syscall.js /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r` > ./syscall_autogenerated.h
CC=gcc npm install
node ./hello.js
```
