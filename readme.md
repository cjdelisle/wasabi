# WasmABI

This is the plan: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript

The idea is to get [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) code to run in Linux as if it were
native code, with full system call support. Then once it is functioning

## Todo list
* [x] [Toolchain for building C/C++ to wasm](https://github.com/WebGHC/wasm-cross)
* [x] [libc port to wasm](https://github.com/WebGHC/musl)
* [x] [Syscall handler w/ pointer translation](https://github.com/cjdelisle/wasmabi/blob/master/SyscallHandler.c)
* [x] Hello_world.wasm running in nodejs with syscall handler
* [] Syscall FFI (rewrite pointers in structures, convert from 32 bit to 64 bit)
* [] Demonstrate a busybox shell with standard unix tools compiled to WASM
* [] Migrate from nodejs to [WAVM](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/WAVM/)
* [] Debugging support
* [] Run multiple processes in the same OS process
  * [] implement `fork()`
* [] Kernelspace demo

## See it in action

The objective is to be cross-platform but this probably won't work on anything other than amd64 for now.
Getting this to run on systems other than linux is out of scope.

To reproduce:

```bash
node ./syscall_tbl/syscall.js /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r` > ./syscall_autogenerated.h
CC=gcc npm install
node ./hello.js
```
